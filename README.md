Implement a 4-bit ADC using an analog circuit simulator
================================================================================
Use the Java [Falstad Analog Circuit Simulator](https://www.falstad.com/circuit-java) for implementing a 4-bit Analog to Digital Converter.

The development of this project involves three main stages:
1. setup a easy-to-run project using `ant` and a custom folder structure starting from the raw source code;
2. develop new components for the emulator that will be used by the 4-bit adc circuit;
3. implement some test circuits and the adc circuit and test them.

## Demo
[Demo video](adc-demo-video.mp4)

## Run
This project has only been tested on linux, both on Ubuntu and Fedora.

In order to install, build and run:
- make sure you have the `java (open)jdk` and `ant` installed. On most linux distros installing `ant` will automatically install all the needed dependencies;
- clone the project;
- `cd` into the root folder of the project;
- run `ant compile` and `ant run` for building and running the project.
